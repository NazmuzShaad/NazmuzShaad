## Oy, World. I'm Shaad ðŸ’¾
Hey I'm Shaad. I'm an aspiring web developer based in Rajshahi, Sirajgong. I make anything from web projects, low level libraries, and DI/UX designs. I make interesting, helpful, sometimes questionable projects and aim to better the world with code. Even though the things I make are fairly insignificant I enjoy making them and hope it can be of use to others. I currently work as a web Developer at TinyFlow.
